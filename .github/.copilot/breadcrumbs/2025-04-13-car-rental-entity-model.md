# Car Rental Entity Relationship Model

## Requirements
- Add a new entity relationship model to the domain knowledge folder
- Document the relationships between entities for a car rental company's online booking system
- Include entities: Make, Model, Vehicle, Tag, and Vehicle-Tag junction entity
- Document attributes and relationships for each entity

## Additional comments from user
- The solution is rebuilding a car rental company's online booking system
- The entity model should reflect the relationships between manufacturers, models, and individual vehicles
- A flexible tagging system is needed to categorize vehicles

## Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Domain Knowledge Structure
- **Task 1.1**: Create the domain knowledge folder structure if it doesn't exist
- **Task 1.2**: Create an entity folder for storing entity relationship models

### Phase 2: Document Car Rental Entity Model
- **Task 2.1**: Create a markdown file to document the entity relationship model
- **Task 2.2**: Document the Make entity with attributes and relationships
- **Task 2.3**: Document the Model entity with attributes and relationships
- **Task 2.4**: Document the Vehicle entity with attributes and relationships
- **Task 2.5**: Document the Tag entity with attributes and relationships
- **Task 2.6**: Document the Vehicle-Tag junction entity with attributes and relationships
- **Task 2.7**: Summarize the entity relationships

### Phase 3: Review and Verification
- **Task 3.1**: Verify all entities, attributes, and relationships are properly documented
- **Task 3.2**: Verify the document is well-formatted and easy to understand

## Decisions
- Using markdown format for the entity relationship model documentation for better readability
- Organizing entities in a hierarchical structure (Make → Model → Vehicle) to represent the natural relationship
- Including a tagging system for flexible categorization of vehicles
- Added a text-based entity relationship diagram to visualize the connections between entities

## Implementation Details
- Created the domain knowledge folder structure
- Created the entities subfolder for storing entity relationship models
- Created car-rental-entities.md document with detailed entity descriptions
- Documented all five entities (Make, Model, Vehicle, Tag, Vehicle-Tag) with their attributes and relationships
- Added a text-based diagram to illustrate the entity relationships

## Changes Made
- Created necessary folder structure for the domain knowledge and entity relationship documentation
- Created domain_knowledge/entities folder for organizing entity models
- Created car-rental-entities.md with complete documentation of the car rental entity relationship model
- Added a text-based diagram to help visualize the entity relationships

## Before/After Comparison
Before: Domain knowledge folder existed but was empty.
After: 
- Organized structure with entities subfolder for entity relationship documentation
- Comprehensive documentation of the car rental entity model with attributes and relationships
- Visual representation of entity relationships with a text-based diagram
